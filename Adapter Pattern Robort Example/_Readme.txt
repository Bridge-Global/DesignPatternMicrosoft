Adapter pattern - Change the behaviour of the method

---------------------------------------------------------

The code shows how a Robot can used for attacking the enemies

. 
The normal attaching will have the following methods
 fireWeapon(), driveForward(), assignDriver(string driver).


While attacking with a Tank we can use the above methods. 

But when we replace the tank with a Robot,
The above methods will have to change to new attacking methods as follows


 fireWeapon()	=> smashWithHands()

 driveForward() => walkForward()

 assignDriver() => reactToHuman()

 
So we will use a EnemyRobortAttackerAdapter to tranform the actions.
